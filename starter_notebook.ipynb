        "### Conversation 1: Understanding Assignment Requirements\n",
        "- **Prompt:** Asked AI to explain assignment requirements and clarify the role of `fetch-my-weather`, `ipywidgets`, and the `main()` function.  \n",
        "- **Result:** Learned that `fetch-my-weather` is the preferred data provider but should fall back to `wttr.in` if unavailable. `ipywidgets` is required to build the interactive user interface. The `main()` function is not for end users but serves as a demo/test harness to show the system works without widgets, useful for grading.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "### Conversation 2: Architectural Options\n",
        "- **Prompt:** Asked AI about the main phases of the project and what architectural approaches would provide maximum modularity and robustness.  \n",
        "- **Result:** AI outlined three approaches: (1) Modular Pipeline, (2) Conversational State, and (3) Data-First Visualization. I chose the Modular Pipeline, which enforces clean data contracts between modules (`parse_question`, `get_weather_data`, `generate_response`, `visualisations`). This approach improved modularity, clarity, and testability.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "### Conversation 3: Data Retrieval Function (`get_weather_data`)\n",
        "- **Prompt:** Asked to give me an organized function code, defining my expected output, regardless of whether the function uses the Python wrapper or falls back to raw wttr.in JSON.  \n",
        "- **Result:** Received a reusable `get_weather_data` function that first tries `fetch-my-weather`, then falls back to `wttr.in`. The function always normalises the data into a consistent format (`location`, `current`, `forecast`, `source`) and includes error handling by returning `{'error': 'message'}` when data cannot be retrieved.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "### Conversation 4: Error Handling for Invalid Locations\n",
        "- **Prompt:** Asked AI how to fix a `NoneType` error when entering a gibberish location name such as \"brosktl\".  \n",
        "- **Result:** Learned to update `get_weather_data` so it always returns a dict, and to add extra checks in `on_fetch_clicked` and `on_ask_clicked`. Now invalid locations return a clear error message like *Error: Failed to retrieve weather for 'jyfju'*\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "### Conversation 5: Precipitation Data Always Zero\n",
        "- **Prompt:** Asked why precipitation values always showed `0.0 mm` regardless of location or days.  \n",
        "- **Result:** Discovered that wttr.in often reports daily precipitation as `0.0`, but actual rain values are stored in the hourly data. The fix was to sum hourly precipitation values instead of averaging or relying on the daily field.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "### Conversation 6: Debugging Utility Functions\n",
        "- **Prompt:** Asked what the helper functions `safe_get` and `to_title` are for, and why I was getting a `NameError: Optional not defined`.  \n",
        "- **Result:** Learned that `safe_get` is a safe way to access nested dict values without crashing, while `to_title` formats location names nicely. The `Optional` error was due to missing `from typing import Optional`. Adding the import (or removing the type hint) resolved the issue."
