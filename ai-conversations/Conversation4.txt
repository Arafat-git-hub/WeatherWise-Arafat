Error Handling for Invalid Locations

Me: I've debugged the crashes, but the actual data is wrong. **Restate the problem:** Precipitation values always show 0.0 mm, no matter the location, and my forecast never returns more than 3 days, even when I set the days to 5. Both issues make the application functionally useless. **I need the exact logic to fix the precipitation calculation, and I need to know why the day limit is occurring.**

AI: The issues stem from known limitations and inconsistencies in the `wttr.in` JSON output:

**1. Precipitation Fix (Data Inconsistency):**
The top-level daily summary `precipMM` field is unreliable and often zeroed. The accurate data is only found in the `hourly` list. Your code is currently reading the unreliable daily field.

**Initial (Failing) Code Logic:**
```python
# Before Prompting (Example 2 - Bug in get_weather_data)
# This uses the incorrect top-level field for precipitation:
day_data = {
    'date': day.get('date'),
    'precipMM': float(day.get('precipMM', 0)) # <-- This is the flawed line
    # ... other fields
}
Improved Code Logic (Result of Prompting):

Python

# After Prompting (Example 2 - Fix in get_weather_data)
# This calculates the total by summing the reliable hourly data:
total_precip_mm = 0.0
hourly_data = day_raw.get('hourly', [])

for hour in hourly_data:
    # Safely convert the string value from the hourly block to float
    total_precip_mm += float(hour.get('precipMM', '0.0') or '0.0')

day_data = {
    'date': day.get('date'),
    'precipMM': round(total_precip_mm, 2) # <-- Corrected value
    # ... other fields
}
