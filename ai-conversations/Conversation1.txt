Me: Can you help me design a `get_weather_data` function that defines my expected output regardless of whether the function uses the Python wrapper or falls back to raw wttr.in JSON? I need to ensure my downstream functions only have to deal with one consistent structure.

AI: Yes. The function should first try to use the `fetch-my-weather` package. If that fails, it must fall back to using the wttr.in JSON endpoint. Both sources should be normalized into a consistent structure so your downstream code doesn’t care which provider was used.

The return structure should look like:
```json
{
  'location': 'City',
  'current': { 'temp_C': float, 'condition': str, 'humidity': int, 'wind_kmph': float },
  'forecast': [
      { 'date': 'YYYY-MM-DD', 'maxtempC': float, 'mintempC': float, 'avgtempC': float, 'precipMM': float, 'hourly': [...] },
      ...
  ],
  'source': 'fetch-my-weather' or 'wttr'
}
If there’s an error, return {'error': '...'} instead of None. That way your UI can check and display error messages safely.

Me: The contract is clear. Now for the implementation detail: The assignment requires the use of fetch-my-weather, but if it fails, I must fall back to raw requests. Request an iterative improvement: If the wrapper fails, I need the precise requests code snippet for the fallback call, ensuring I retrieve the data in the exact JSON format (format=j1) that matches the structure my normalization logic expects. Provide the Python code using requests.get for the fallback.

AI: That is a critical point. If your fallback doesn't request JSON, your parsing logic will instantly fail. You must explicitly include ?format=j1 in the URL to receive the machine-readable JSON object.

The Required Fallback Code Snippet:

Python

# Fallback mechanism inside get_weather_data function:
import requests
# ...
except Exception:
    # 1. URL encode the location for safety
    encoded_location = requests.utils.quote(location)
    
    # 2. Construct the URL with the JSON format flag
    url = f"[https://wttr.in/](https://wttr.in/){encoded_location}?format=j1" 
    
    # 3. Execute the request and parse the JSON
    response = requests.get(url, timeout=5)
    response.raise_for_status() # Crucial for detecting 4xx/5xx errors
    raw_json_data = response.json()
    
    # After this, proceed with normalization using the defined contract.
This ensures that the fallback retrieves the correct format, maintaining consistency with your overall data contract and satisfying the robust design requirements.
