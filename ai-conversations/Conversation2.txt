Me: Sounds right. I want to make sure we tackle this smoothly. Before we jump into the first function, what are our main phases, and what architectural options should we consider? I want to aim for maximum modularity and robustness.

AI: That focus on modularity is key. I see four main functional blocks: 1) Data Retrieval (connecting to wttr.in), 2) NLU (parsing the user's question), 3) Response Generation (creating the advice), and 4) Visualization.

To structure how these blocks interact, here are three distinct architectural approaches:

Approach 1: The Modular Pipeline (Recommended)
Concept: This treats the application as a strict sequential flow: Input → NLU → Data Retrieval → Response.
Pros: Highly testable because each function (parse_question, get_weather_data, generate_response) is isolated and only depends on the output of the previous one. We can define clear data contracts (like standardized dictionary output) for every stage.
Cons: Requires slightly more initial effort to define those contracts perfectly.

Approach 2: Conversational State Management
Concept: The main loop maintains a session object (or state dictionary) that stores context (like the last location requested, or preferred units).
Pros: Excellent for user experience. Users can ask follow-up questions like "What about tomorrow?" without having to repeat "in London."
Cons: The core logic becomes more complex and tightly coupled to the main() function, making unit testing harder.

Approach 3: Data-First, Visualization Focus
Concept: Data Retrieval is the first priority. We use the retrieved weather data to immediately generate the necessary visualizations, and the advisory response is simply an annotation on the visual.
Pros: Quickly satisfies the visualization requirement. Good for data exploration apps.
Cons: The NLU/Advisory system becomes an afterthought, making the overall conversational aspect feel less intelligent.

Me: Approach 1, the Modular Pipeline, sounds like the best fit, especially since I need to demonstrate intentional prompting around data contracts and robustness. It forces us to define the standardized data output from the start.

AI: Perfect. I agree. That means our immediate next step is defining the exact data contract for the get_weather_data function. We need to decide what fields (temperature, precipitation, condition) and format it will always return, regardless of whether it uses a Python wrapper or falls back to raw API JSON. This is crucial for isolating the NLU and Response modules from the API's messiness.

Me: Great. Let's start with the Data Retrieval function then, and focus immediately on error handling and structuring the output.
