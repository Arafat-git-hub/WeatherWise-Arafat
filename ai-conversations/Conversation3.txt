Data Retrieval Function (get_weather_data)

Me: I get a `NoneType` error when entering a gibberish location like "jyfju". The code crashes, pointing to my widget callback trying to access `.get('error')` on the result of `get_weather_data`. I know this means the function implicitly returned `None`. **Challenge this edge case: What is the most robust way to guarantee `get_weather_data` *always* returns a dictionary containing either valid data or an explicit `'error'` key, ensuring the crash never happens?**

AI: That confirms a failure in your final `except` block, which means the function falls through and returns `None`. The fix requires explicitly returning a dictionary in **all** failure paths.

**Initial (Failing) Logic:**
```python
# Before Prompting (Example 1 - Bug)
# ...
except Exception:
    # This block executes but doesn't return anything explicitly
    print("API failed.") 
    # Implicitly returns None, causing crash in UI callback.
Improved Code Logic (Fix 1 - Always Return Dict):
# After Prompting (Example 1 - Fix)
# This handles the internal function logic:
except Exception:
    return {'error': f"Failed to retrieve weather for '{location}'. {traceback.format_exc()}"}

Me: That fixes the function's contract. However, in the widget callback, I'm currently using a simple if 'error' in weather: check. If weather is somehow still None (perhaps due to an unforeseen library error), it could still crash. Request an iterative improvement: How should I modify the widget callback logic to check the function's result for both None and the presence of the 'error' key, to make the UI update logic completely crash-proof?

AI: To make your widget callback truly resilient, you must first check the type/existence of the variable before checking its contents.

Improved Callback Check (Fix 2 - Widget Logic):
# Improved Widget Check:
weather = get_weather_data(...)

# Check 1: Ensure it's a dictionary (not None) AND Check 2: Look for the 'error' key
if not isinstance(weather, dict) or 'error' in weather:
    # Safely display the error message, or a default error if 'weather' is truly unreadable.
    error_message = weather.get('error', "Unknown Critical Error.") 
    output_widget.value = f"Error: {error_message}"
else:
    # Proceed with processing valid data
    process_weather_data(weather)

Me: This was a much stronger defensive programming practice, thanks for the work!
